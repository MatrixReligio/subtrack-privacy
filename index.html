    <p class="date">Last updated: February 23, 2026</p>

    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>SubTrack ("the App") is a subscription management app developed by MatrixReligio LLC. We are committed to protecting your privacy. This policy explains how we handle your data.</p>

    <h2>Data Collection and Storage</h2>
    <p>SubTrack stores all your subscription data, categories, and settings <strong>locally on your device</strong>. We do not collect, transmit, or store any personal data on external servers.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Subscription data</strong> (names, prices, dates, categories) is stored on-device using Apple's SwiftData framework.</li>
        <li><strong>iCloud Sync</strong>: If you enable iCloud, your data is synced through Apple's iCloud infrastructure. We do not have access to your iCloud data. Please refer to <a href="https://www.apple.com/privacy/">Apple's Privacy Policy</a> for details.</li>
        <li><strong>Monthly income reference</strong> (optional): If you provide this, it is stored locally and used only to calculate a spending health score. It is never transmitted.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Exchange Rate Data</h2>
    <p>The App fetches currency exchange rates from a third-party API (FloatRates) to support multi-currency conversion. Only the exchange rate data is downloaded; no personal information is sent to this service.</p>

    <h2>In-App Purchases</h2>
    <p>SubTrack offers optional Pro features via in-app purchases processed by Apple's App Store. We do not collect or store any payment information. All transactions are handled by Apple. Please refer to <a href="https://www.apple.com/privacy/">Apple's Privacy Policy</a> for details.</p>

    <h2>Analytics and Tracking</h2>
    <p>SubTrack does <strong>not</strong> use any analytics, tracking, or advertising frameworks. We do not collect usage data, crash reports, or behavioral analytics.</p>

    <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>The App does not integrate with any third-party analytics, advertising, or social media SDKs.</p>

    <h2>Notifications</h2>
    <p>SubTrack may send local notifications to remind you of upcoming subscription renewals. These notifications are generated entirely on your device and do not involve any external servers.</p>

    <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>SubTrack is not directed at children under 13. We do not knowingly collect data from children.</p>
